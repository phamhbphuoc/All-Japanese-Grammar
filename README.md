# All-Japanese-Grammar
I created a summary of all the grammar points from [どんな時どう使う日本語表現文型辞典](https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%81%A9%E3%82%93%E3%81%AA%E3%81%A8%E3%81%8D%E3%81%A9%E3%81%86%E4%BD%BF%E3%81%86%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E%E8%A1%A8%E7%8F%BE%E6%96%87%E5%9E%8B%E8%BE%9E%E5%85%B8-%E5%8F%8B%E6%9D%BE-%E6%82%A6%E5%AD%90/dp/4757418868) , categorized by their meaning, so that it is easy to look up grammar points. 

Formats include png, pdf, Mindnode file, csv, xlsx, orginal scanned pages.

You can use the pdf file to search for the grammar points you want to look up, then use the book to learn more about it.
